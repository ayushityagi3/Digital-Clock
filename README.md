                                                    DIGITAL CLOCK

This project consists of a simple digital clock web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application displays hours, minutes, and seconds in separate styled boxes arranged horizontally.

Files Included: index.html: This file defines the structure of the web page. It includes a div container with class .clock that holds individual div elements for displaying hours, minutes, and seconds. Uses external CSS (style.css) and JavaScript (script.js) files for styling and functionality.

style.css: Defines the visual presentation of the digital clock. Applies styles such as positioning, colors, fonts, and animations. Uses flexbox for layout, ensuring the clock is centered on the page. Includes animations (@keyframes) for a bouncing effect on time updates.

script.js: Implements the clock functionality using JavaScript. Dynamically generates HTML for hours, minutes, and seconds using arrays and template literals. Retrieves current time using Date object and updates the clock every second using setInterval. Utilizes CSS classes and transitions for smooth animation effects when updating time.

Key Features: Dynamic Time Display: Displays real-time hours, minutes, and seconds. Styling and Animation: Stylish presentation with box shadows, rounded corners, and a bouncing animation effect. Responsive Design: Designed to be responsive with viewport meta tag for different screen sizes. Clean Code: Organized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with clear separation of concerns for easy maintenance and readability.

Usage: Open index.html in any web browser to view the digital clock. The clock updates automatically every second to reflect the current time.

Purpose: This project serves as a demonstration of basic web development techniques including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. It showcases how to create a visually appealing digital clock with dynamic content and animations using fundamental web technologies.
